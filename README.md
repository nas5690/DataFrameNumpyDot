# DataFrameNumpyDot
Using Python Numpy Dot in a DataFrame

In this example, I am to calculate the total number of points a country could have received from their medal count in the 2014 Sochi Olympics. I used the numpy.dot function to create a new data frame called 'olympic_points_df' that included a column called 'country_name' and another one called 'points.'
